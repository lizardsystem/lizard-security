Lizard-security middleware
==========================

Idea: copy-paste django-tls' middleware and add some. (No, this makes it
harder to re-use django-tls somewhere else).

Task: make list of user groups in the request

Task: make list of datasets we have view permissions for. If data sets are enabled.
